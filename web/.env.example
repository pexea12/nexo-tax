# NOTE: On NixOS, update "puppeteerExecutablePath" in package.json to point to your chromium binary.
# Find it with: which chromium
# On CI/deployment servers (Ubuntu, Debian) this is not needed — remove the setting.

# NOTE: Convert public/og-image.svg to public/og-image.png (1200x630) before deploying.
# Example with Inkscape: inkscape public/og-image.svg --export-png=public/og-image.png -w 1200 -h 630
# Or use any online SVG-to-PNG converter.
